JDK 11 new features

    1.JEP 321: HTTP Client
        Summary
        Standardize the incubated HTTP Client API introduced in JDK 9, via JEP 110, and updated in JDK 10.
        Provide a standardized API, in the java.net.http package, based upon the incubated API, and
        Remove the incubated API.

        This is a replacement of the old URLConnection API

        The module name and the package name of the standard API will be java.net.http

        Once build an HttpClient can be used multiple times. It is build using the builder pattern.

        An HttpRequest is built using an HttpRequestBuilder, where the request URI is set, the HTTP method, the
        request body, headers and timeout. An HttpRequest can be used multiple times.

        An HttpResponse is not created directly, but is returned as a result of sending an HttpRequest.

        Requests can be sent either synchronously or asynchronously.
            Synchronous API blocks until an HttpResponse is available.
            Asynchronous returns a CompletableFuture<HttpResponse>

        BodyHandler interface allows inspection of the response code and headers before the actual response body is received.
